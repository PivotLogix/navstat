NAVSTAT
=======

ABOUT
-----
NAVSTAT is being constructed as a simple yet effective navigation station for marine applications.
It is important to realize that it is not being made to replace a full chartplotter, but rather  
provides a set of tools that will enable easy access and visualization of important navigational 
information. This project is still in its infancy and as such, has a limited feature set at the 
moment.

REQUIREMENTS
------------
NAVSTAT requires the following:
- GPSD - http://www.catb.org/gpsd/
- PyGame - http://www.pygame.org
- GPS serial or USB puck that is functional with GPSD

These libraries can be installed from their websites or with the following command: 
sudo apt-get install gpsd gpsd-clients python-pygame

HOW TO USE
----------
Ensure that GPSD is running correctly and has recognized your GPS puck. You can check this by
running the following command: xgps

This will launch an application that will show you your current GPS data. Please consult the GPSD
website if you encounter problems.

Run NAVSTAT by opening the NAVSTAT.py file with your favourite python editor. Run the script.

Important hotkey info:
SPACE - changes NAVSTAT from Night Mode to default colors (Night mode is on by default right now).
TAB - Switches between fullscreen and Mini Mode (Mini mode is on by default right now).
T - Toggles tracking on and off (Tracking is on by default right now).
ESCAPE - Quits NAVSTAT
